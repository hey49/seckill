## What is seckill?

Seckill refers to a marketing strategy in which a company offers products or services at a heavily discounted price for a short period of time, usually just a few hours or even minutes. The purpose of seckill is to generate a high volume of sales in a short period of time, creating a sense of urgency and excitement among consumers.

Seckill promotions are often used by e-commerce companies, particularly in China, as a way to attract new customers and boost sales. During a seckill event, the products or services are usually sold on a first-come, first-served basis, and once the available inventory is sold out, the promotion ends.

## What I did to implement seckill

- Second-kill system using Spring Boot and Java, which involved creating optimized SQL queries using MyBatis and using Lombok to reduce boilerplate code

- Optimized the system by implementing page staticization, significantly reducing page load times and server strain

- Reduced database access by utilizing Redis caching, improving system efficiency and response times

- Utilized Docker to run RabbitMQ, allowing for asynchronous operations and peak shaving, and implemented SQL transactions to ensure data consistency

- Conducted thorough stress testing with JMeter, successfully withstanding pressure up to 1 million users
